Although, JavaScript itself is a slow language.
        Flexible model requires some code that slows it down. It's not DOM manipulations, but actually
        javascript that I couldn't make lighter. Being a part of dojo/widget structure also implies some overhead.
    </p><p>        
        Almost all operations require small constant time when single node is involved. Depending on your
        application you may notice slowdown when (most common) creating lots of nodes or
        performing other batch operations.
    </p><p>
        In my tests 1000 nodes required 0.7-0.8 sec, growth is linear, depth does not matter, children
        are created with  <code class="code">createSimple</code> and added to parent all at once with <code class="code">setChildren</code>.                
    </p><p>Creation from markup or with standard createWidget/addChild routines is about 2 times slower,
        because these routines are generic.</p><p>Memory footprint (IE,FF) is about 1M per 100 nodes</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e20"></a>Comparison</h3></div></div></div><p>Fast node creation with dojo tree is 2-3 times slower than xtree 1.7, another tree widget,
            nicely optimized for performance.
        </p><p>The ultimate performance solution could probably be tree creation on server-side ;)</p></div></div></body></html>
