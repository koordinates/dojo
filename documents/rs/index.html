<h1>DHTML RPC Revisited</h1>

<p>DHTML RPC allows JavaScript on a webpage to call a remote server without a page reload. Although techniques for RPC doing have been around almost since the beginning of www-time (DynAPI, Brent Ashley), there has been a recent resurgence in popularity coincident with the emergence of several relatively compatible modern DHTML browsers (Mozilla, Safari, Opera, IE) along with many high profile example applications (links to apps, perhaps just google search on XMLHttp/RPC or something).</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Approaches</h2>
<p>There are an unfortunately diverse variety of ways to approach DHTML RPC, each with their own unique advantages and disadvantages. We are not going to cover every single one here, as that would take far more time than we have. Instead, we'll focus on the current best practices for DHTML RPC on the public internet.</p>

<h3>XmlHttp</h3>
<p>Uses the XMLHttpRequest object, which has become a de-facto standard, to make a synchronous or asynchronous web request. Both GET and POST HTTP methods are widely supported. Although originally designed for XML, any textual format can be retrieved through the responseText property.</p>

<h2>History, URLs, and accessibility</h2>
<p>Though DHTML RPC can radically improve the user experience through increased responsiveness, most implementations simultaneously negate those improvements by breaking the back button and the URL bar. These are critical components of the web browsing UI and must be preserved.</p>
