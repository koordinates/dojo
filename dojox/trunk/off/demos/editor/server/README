This directory contains a server-side implementation of Moxie to illustrate how to create a full client/server application with Dojo Offline.

Dependencies

Moxie requires the following pieces of software to install:
* Java 1.5+ 

Building & Running
------------------

A build.sh file is provided in this directory; it will only currently run on Unix-based machines (Mac OS X, Linux, etc.)

Running the server-side of Moxie is simple. Just type:

java -jar moxie.jar

from this directory, and the Moxie server-side will start running, with an embedded web-server (Jetty) and database (Derby) already setup for you. In a web-browser, go to the following URL:

to run Moxie against your local server.
