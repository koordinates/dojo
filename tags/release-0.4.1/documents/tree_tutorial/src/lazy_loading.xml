        <para>Every data object you send is created with <property>Tree#createNode</property> call.</para>
        
        <para>You want to pass a special object, specify widgetName in <property>widgetName</property> property of your object.
        </para>
        
        <para>Another option is to change <methodname>defaultChildWidget</methodname> property of the tree.
            Helpful in case when you have your own widgets and use them elsewhere instead of TreeNode</para>
