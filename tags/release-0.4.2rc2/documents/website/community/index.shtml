<h1>Getting Involved Is Easy</h1>
<p>
	Dojo is Open Source software, and we'd love for you to get involved with
	the project. Contributors use several tools to help keep development
	organized, including <a
	href="http://dojotoolkit.org/svn/dojo/trunk">Subversion</a> for source code
	control and <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/trac/report/6">Trac</a> for
	bug-tracking.
</p>
<p>
	Discussions about development on and with Dojo usually happens on the <a
	href="/mailman/listinfo/dojo-interest">dojo-interest</a> list, and project
	developers often hang out in IRC at <strong>irc.freenode.net #dojo</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Dojo also depends in large part on the continued generosity of our
	corporate sponsors who provide logistical, financial, and personnel support
	for the project. If your organization would like to help Dojo flourish,
	please get in touch with <a href="mailto:alex@dojotoolkit.org">Alex
	Russell</a>.
</p>
<h1>Becoming A Committer</h1>
<p>
	Dojo is an Open Source project, so we keep our standards very high and try
	to make decisions with community input. Therefore, in order to contribute
	code to Dojo a developer must submit a <a
	href="http://dojotoolkit.org/icla.txt">Contributors License Agreement</a>
	to the Dojo Foundation. Contributors who make large contributions or who
	have earned the respect of their peers are granted commit privileges and
	can directly apply their changes to Dojo for everyone else to benefit from.
	Committers are allowed to vote in Foundation matters and in general
	determine the direction of the project.
</p>

	You can find an up-to-date <a href="contributors.shtml">list of Dojo
	committers here</a>.
