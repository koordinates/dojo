<h1>Spider 2D</h1>
<h5>
A spider chart is a graphical method of displaying multivariate data in the form of a two-dimensional chart of three or more quantitative variables represented on axes starting from the same point. The relative position and angle of the axes is typically uninformative.
</h5>
<ul>
	<li>
	It consists of a sequence of equi-angular spokes, called radii, with each spoke representing one of the variables. The data length of a spoke is proportional to the magnitude of the variable for the data point relative to the maximum magnitude of the variable across all data points. 
	A line is drawn connecting the data values for each spoke. This gives the plot a star-like appearance and the origin of the name of this plot.
	</li>
	<li>
	Spider charts are useful when you want to look at several different factors all related to one item. spider charts have multiple axes along which data can be plotted
	</li>
</ul>

<h5>
Application
</h5>
<ul>

	<li>
	The "spider chart" can be a format commonly used by management consultants to show their clients how an organization compares with those in similar companies.
	</li>
	<li>
	It also can be used as the control of quality improvement to display the performance metrics of any ongoing program.
	</li>
	<li>
	Furthermore, it is also being used in sports to chart players' strengths and weaknesses.
	</li>
	<li>
	For example, you could use a spider chart to compile data about a wide receiver on a professional football team. On one axis, you could plot the percentage of passes caught. 
	Another axis would show his yards per completion; another, his completions per 100 plays; another, blocks made; and a final axis might show his interceptions
	So far as we can see, the spider has a broad application area.
	</li>
</ul>
<h5>
Comparison with radar chart in dojox.charting
</h5>
<ul>
	<li>
	Spider charts differ from radar chart in that a spider chart is a chart that has N "y" axes while radar chart has only one "y" axis, all radiating from a central point, 
	where each "y" axis represents a specific category. For example, there are 5 "y" axes: GDP, area, population, inflation and growth here.
	</li>
	<li>
	The radar chart, however, instead of being drawn in a typical linear X/Y space, the radar chart is drawn using a circular plot, with specific X values being shown using an arbitrary number of spokes drawn from a center point. 
	These charts are useful for showing data over a cyclical set of values (for instance, hours of a day, minutes in an hour, etc.). With a radar chart, data is plotted in much the same way as with a typical line or area chart.
	</li>
	<li><strong>
	Actually, the radar chart is somewhat similar with line chart, the major difference between them is: line chart has a "straight" X axis while radar chart has a "circular" X axis, and the orientation of their Y axis is opposite.
	</strong></li>
</ul>
