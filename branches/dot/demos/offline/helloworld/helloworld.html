		<h1>Hello World</h1>
		
		<h2>This is a simple Hello World program using
			Dojo Offline. It doesn't really do much --
			it gives a code sample of how to work with
			Dojo Offline.</h2>
			
		<p>In our HTML, we create a DIV with the special id "dot-widget", which
			Dojo Offline will automagically fill with a default
			Dojo Offline widget that tells the user when they are online
			or offline; gives them sync messages; and provides instructions
			on how to download and install the small Dojo Offline client
			runtime. It basically handles all of the UI tedium and hard
			stuff of providing good offline feedback to a user.
			Here is that widget inserted into the page:</p>
			
		<!-- 
			Place the Dojo Offline widget here; it will be automagically
		 	filled into any element with ID "dot-widget".
		 -->
		<div id="dot-widget"></div>	
		
		<p>The default Dojo Offline UI will fill in your application
			name automatically into the UI based on what you set 
			<code>dojo.off.ui.appName</code> to in your JavaScript 
			file; in our case we set it to "Hello World".</p>
			
		<p>It will also fill out the <i>Learn How</i> link with your
			app name; click that link now to see an autogenerated
			page that helps your users make sure they can work
			with your application offline. That page automatically
			figures out if Dojo Offline is installed or not, and
			provides instructions on downloading it if not and
			providing an easy link to running your application
			offline (which is just autoset to be the URL of this
			current page, btw)</p>
			
		<p>Debug output:</p>
