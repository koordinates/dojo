    <para>Tree is a generic thing, a "must have" of any widget collection. 
        Unfortunately, javacript toolkit should be lightweight, so I couldn't take a Swing
        tree component and simply copy it. Almost all components are optional and event-based,
        feel free to hook on whatever you'd like.

    <para>
        Basic things are shown in tests (dojo/tests/widget/treeV3), so you might want to check them first and copy-paste
        exactly the things you need. The tutorial is meant to provide deeper understanding for those
        who want to extend/modify tree behavior.
     </para>
    <para>
        This documentation refers to new treeV3, not to stable and old dojo Tree widget.
        Feel free to suggest features and test/critisize existing solutions.
