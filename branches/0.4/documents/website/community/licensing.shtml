<h1>Dojo Licensing</h1>
<p>
	Dojo is Open Source software, distributed by a non-profit foundation which
	has been set up for the purpose of providing a vendor-neutral owner of Dojo
	intellectual property. In order to ensure to users of Foundation projects
	that there is no ambiguity or hidden liability regarding the use of
	Foundation code, all contributors are required to provide signed
	Contributor License Agreements (<a
	href="http://dojotoolkit.org/icla.txt">individual</a> and <a
	href="http://dojotoolkit.org/ccla.txt">corporate</a>). 
</p>
<p>
	All <a
	href="http://dojotoolkit.org/community/contributors.shtml">committers</a>
	on Dojo Foundation projects have a vote in Foundation matters. The
	Foundation is run by contributors, operates in a transparent way, and is
	funded exclusively by donations. The licensing goals of the Foundations are
	spelled out in a short <a
	href="http://dojotoolkit.org/docs/licensing.html">document that informs
	Foundation decisions.</a>
</p>
<h2>Dual Licensing</h2>
<p>
	The Dojo Toolkit is currently dual-licensed. The preferred license is the
	<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/afl-2.1.php">Academic Free License
	v2.1</a>. All Dojo Foundation projects release their code under the terms
	of this license. It is almost never necessary to exercise the "dual"
	portion of the dual-licensing terms since the AFL is well written, widely
	accepted, and incredibly permissive.
</p>
<p>
	For users who face the problem of artificial ambiguity the FSF has created
	regarding the compatibility of the AFL and the (L)GPL, The Dojo Toolkit
	may alternately be used under the terms of the <a
	href="http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">BSD License</a>. Both
	the AFL and the BSD licenses meet the licensing goals of the Dojo
	Foundation.
</p>
<p>
	This "dual licensing" system is similar to licensing systems employed by
	projects such as MySQL and the Mozilla Foundation. In almost every case,
	you will not need to understand the differences between the Dojo licenses
	or choose anything other than the AFL. If you have questions regarding Dojo
	licensing, please do not hesitate to contact <a
	href="mailto:alex@dojotoolkit.org">Alex Russell</a>, current President of
	the Dojo Foundation.
