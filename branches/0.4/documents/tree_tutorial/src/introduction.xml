        This documentation refers to new TreeV3, not to stable Tree widget. Many classes have V3 on the end for TreeV3, 
        but that suffix can be omitted, because it will be removed in dojo 0.5.

        Basic things are shown in tests (dojo/tests/widget/treeV3), so you might want to check them first and copy-paste
        exactly the things you need. The tutorial is meant to provide deeper understanding for those
        who want to extend/modify tree behavior.
