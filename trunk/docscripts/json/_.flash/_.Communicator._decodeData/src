 certain XMLish characters break Flash's wire serialization for
 ExternalInterface; these are encoded on the 
 DojoExternalInterface side into a custom encoding, rather than
 the standard entity encoding, because otherwise we won't be able to
 differentiate between our own encoding and any entity characters
 that are being used in the string itself
data = data.replace(/\&custom_lt\;/g, "<");
data = data.replace(/\&custom_gt\;/g, ">");

 Unfortunately, Flash returns us our String with special characters
 like newlines broken into seperate characters. So if \n represents
 a new line, Flash returns it as "\" and "n". This means the character
 is _not_ a newline. This forces us to eval() the string to cause
 escaped characters to turn into their real special character values.
data = eval('"' + data + '"');

return data;
