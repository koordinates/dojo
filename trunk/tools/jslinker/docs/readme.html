<h3><a name="Overview">1.0 Overview</a></h3> 

<p>The JavaScript source code can be represented in different levels of granularity. The JavaScript Linker uses the Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) representation, which represents the lowest level of detail, to model the source code. One of the main task for this project was to write a JavaCC compatible grammar that strictly follows the ECMA Specification. JavaCC uses this grammar to build a custom parser than can read and analyze the JavaScript source, which in turn, is used to build the JavaScript Linker.</p>

<p>The purpose of JavaScript Linker is to process HTML/JavaScript code base to prepare code for deployment by reducing file size, create source code documentation, obfuscate source code to protect intellectual property, and help gather source code metrics for source code analysis & improvements. The source code modifications can either be made in place by overwriting the input files, or can be saved to a user-specified output directory. </p>

<p>This latest alpha release of the JavaScript Linker uses the new ECMA grammar <i>(supports ECMA-262 Standard 3rd edition)</i>. This release is meant for testing purposes only.</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Currently Supported Tasks</h4> <p>This is the list of JavaScript Linker tasks supported in this release: </p>


<ol> 

<li>
  <p>
	<b>Import</b> -  Import JavaScript file from Html documents
  </p>
  <p>
	Import task finds and imported all input source files which have not been explicitly declared by the user, but are referenced with src attributes in HTML. 
  </p>
</li>


<li>
  <p>
	<b>Require</b> -  Import source files specified by the require statements included in the Dojo source code.
  </p>
  <p>
	Require task helps process require statements referenced in the Dojo source code. This task, like the ant build scripts included with Dojo, helps in constructing a custom profile which includes only those modules used by your application. This tool automatically processess the require statements from the Dojo source without any intervention from the user.
  </p>
</li>


	<li>
		<p><b>Janitor</b> - unused function removal via dependency analysis</p>
		<p>Janitor task is used to strip out unused functions from the JavaScript source code. Janitor performs a static code analysis constructing a function call graph for all global functions. Entry points are also calculated from all source files that have imported after processing the Dojo require statements. Every function not reachable from the graph is considered unused and gets removed.</p>
	
	    <p> There are two cases where the analysis needs help from the user: Functions that are only called by the server (through the pipe), and functions that 
	    are composed with string concatenation of the function name which then gets passed to eval or similar reflective functionality. The user can enumerate 
		the function names in these cases in a property that declares them protected from removal.</p>
	    <p> The entry points are calculated from all global statements in all JavaScript source code visible to the tool in that run. This might not be desirable, 
		so there is a property that when set to true makes the task only consider JavaScript code that was actually imported in an import statement in an HTML 
	    file.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<b>Known Issues:</b>
			<li>
				<p>
				The current version of the code is not very aggressive in removing unsed function. It always errs on the side of caution. However, you can control how aggresive Janitor is by changing a property called <i>'task.janitor.process.global'</i> in the project file. Setting this property helps remove more unused functions but it also has the potential to break some test cases. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>HTML event handlers are <b>ignored</b> and they are <b>not used</b> as entry points into the call graph. This feature is disabled because the html parser used with the earlier version had a incompatible licence. This feature will be supported after the work on new html grammar is complete. </p>
			</li>
	   </ul>

	<p>Janitor task will be improved incrementally in the later releases.</p>
</li>



<li><p><b>Muffler</b> - assert/alert, developer "noise" removal</P>

<p>Muffler is used to remove developer noise, like alert and assert statements. For specified identifiers that match declared global functions, the function declarations themselves are removed. Examples of statements that are removed are: 
<pre id="noteTable">
	assert( foo < 3 );

	alert( "this is a fire drill" );
</pre>

<p>It can also removes code that cannot be reached if certain specified identifiers have declared Boolean values. For example, by declaring the identifier debug = false, the code inside the following if-statement cannot be reached, and so is stripped:</p>
<pre id="noteTable">
	if( debug ) {

		alert( "here" );

	} 
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Pretty Printer </b> – Writing back the results from other tasks</p>
<p>
Print writes out the result from the other tasks and strips out whitespace, newlines and/or comments if desired. If this task is omitted from the task list, then the run is like a dry-run that won't write out anything. The user can look in the log files to check that the run is doing what is expected, and then add this task to the task list to do the actual writing out of the results. 
</p>

  <p> The print result is written out in an output directory and the files are 
    written in a directory tree structure that is identical to the input directory 
    structure. Since the input can be a list of input directories, the output 
    tree structure will start at the point where the input directories differ 
    (the common prefix is not mirrored). The output can also be done in place 
    by specifying a property.</p>
  <p> By specifying pretty-printing properties, one can control the stripping 
    of newlines, whitespace and comments.</p>

	<ul>
		<b>Known Issues:</b>
		<li>
			<p>
				This version does not support stripping of newline characters
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

</li>

</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is recommended for normal project deployment use to create a property <b>.prj</b> file that defines all the properties and customizes the tool for the  project. This is less awkward than creating long command lines with  multiple properties. A <a href="template.prj" target="newwindow">template.prj</a> file is provided for convenience. All the available properties are described there as well as in this document. At minimum one should define a list of input directories, an output directory and a list of tasks. If you name your property file &quot;jsl.prj&quot; and start jsl from the directory where that file lives it will pick it up automatically without needing a -p option
at startup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Setting Up a Project File</b></p>
<p>Open the <a href="template.prj" target="newwindow"> 
  template.prj</a> file and set values for the properties defined there. The values 
  you set will control what <a href="#SpecifyingInput"> input</a> gets processed, 
  what <a href="#Tasks">tasks</a> get executed, and tailors the individual tasks 
  to the needs of your project. The documentation for each property specifies 
  valid property values, and default values when no value is specified. </p>
<p><b><i>Note:</i></b><i> Don't use quotes for any specified values.</i> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <b>Specifying Input</b> </p>
<p>The input HTML and JavaScript files should contain valid JavaScript and HTML (i.e. follow standards). If it happens that the tool cannot parse a certain file, it can be excluded from the run.</p> 
<p>Here are all the properties that specify input to the tool:<br>

<b>File Patterns</b>
  <p>File patterns as property values are very useful to conveniently declare 
    a set of files without having to list each file in the set. JSL supports the 
    classic file system patterns <code>*</code> and <code>?</code> and also supports 
    the <code>**</code> pattern. The <a href="#ANT"><b>ANT</b></a> documentation 
    explains patterns best:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Patterns</b></p>
  <p>Patterns are used for inclusion and exclusion. These patterns look very much 
    like the patterns used in DOS and UNIX:</p>
  <p><code>*</code> matches zero or more characters, <code>?</code> matches one character.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Examples</b>:</p>
    <p><code><b>*.java</b></code> matches <code>.java</code>, <code>x.java</code>and 
      <code>FooBar.java</code>, but not <code>FooBar.xml</code> (does not end 
      with .java).</p>
    <p><code><b>?.java</b></code> matches <code>x.java</code>, <code>A.java</code>, 
      but not <code>.java</code> or <code>xyz.java</code> (both don't have one 
      character before <code>.java</code>).</p>
    <p>Combinations of *'s and ?'s are allowed.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Matching is done per-directory. This means that the first directory in the 
    pattern is matched against the first directory in the path to match, then 
    the second directory is matched, and so on. For example, if the pattern is 
    <code>/?abc/*/*.java</code> and the path is <code>/xabc/foobar/test.java</code>, 
    the first <code>?abc</code> is matched with <code>xabc</code>, then <code>*</code> 
    is matched with <code>foobar</code>, and finally <code>*.java</code> is matched 
    with <code>test.java</code>. They all match, so the path matches the pattern.</p>
  <p>To make things a bit more flexible, we add one extra feature, which makes 
    it possible to match multiple directory levels. This can be used to match 
    a complete directory tree, or a file anywhere in the directory tree. To do 
    this, <code>**</code> must be used as the name of a directory. When <code>**</code> is used as the name 
    of a directory in the pattern, it matches zero or more directories. For example: 
    <code>/test/**</code> matches all files/directories under <code>/test/</code>, such as <code>/test/x.java</code>, 
    or <code>/test/foo/bar/xyz.html</code>, but not <code>/xyz.xml</code>.</p>
  <p>The properties that accept values with file patterns are:<br>
  </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>jsl.sources</b> (X)<br>
      <b>jsl.sources.exclude<br>
      jsl.sources.fw<br>
      jsl.sources.encodings</b> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>(X) <i><b>Note:</b> This property can only have <code>*</code> and <code>?</code> 
    in the last directory part and no <code>**</code> pattern.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <br><b>File Encodings</b>
  <p>JSL reads an application's source code with the standard ISO-8859-1 encoding. 
    This is usually sufficient for correctly interpreting the data in the files, 
    and correctly writing the results out after processing. However, international 
    application source code can have files localized for particular languages 
    that need different encodings. JSL supports these encodings by correctly reading 
    the files using them, and respecting the encoding when writing out. Because 
    it is impossible to guess the encoding of a text file from the stream of data 
    the file contains, it is necessary to specify to JSL with a set of properties 
    any file encoding that differs from the default ISO-8859-1 encoding. For example, 
    to specify a group of files having the chinese encoding <code>Big5</code> 
    the encodings property would be set as follows:</p>
  <p><code>jsl.sources.encodings.Big5=**/src/localized/chinese/*</code></p>
  <p>All the charset encoding names supported by java j2se 1.5 are legal encoding 
    names (see <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/intl/encoding.doc.html" target="newwindow"> 
    Encoding in JDK 1.5</a>).</p>

<h3>Tasks</h3>
<p>The list of tasks includes: <a href="#Import">import</a>, <a href="#Require">require</a>, <a href="#Print">print</a>, <a href="#Janitor">janitor</a> , <a href="#Muffler">muffler</a>. More tasks will follow.</p>
<p> The <a href="#Print"> print</a> task writes out the results. The <a href="#Import">import</a> 
  task finds input source files which have not been explicitly declared by the 
  user, but are referenced with src attributes in HTML. The import task is usually 
  the first, and the print task is usually the last. The order in which the tasks 
  are specified is important because the tasks form a pipeline, and the output 
  of one task is the input to the next.</p>
<p>The <b>-a</b> option (or the <b>jsl.tasklist</b> property ) should 
  be a comma-separated list of task names.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<blockquote><b> Example command line:</b> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>-a import,muffler,janitor,jammer2,jabber,print </b></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The task list can also be specified in the property file:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>jsl.tasklist</b> property<br>
    Tasks to be executed by JSL in this run<br>
    (required property)<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>value</b> is a comma-separated list of task names<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example:</b> </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><b> jsl.tasklist = import,muffler,janitor,jammer2,jabber,print</b> 
      </p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>

<b>Short description of each task and its properties.</b><br/>

<p><b>Import<a name="Import"></a></b></p>
<p>Import task finds input source files which have not been explicitly declared by the user, but are referenced with src attributes in HTML. <br>
</p>


<p><b>Require<a name="Require"></a></b></p>
<p>Require task helps process require statements referenced in the Dojo source code. This task, like the ant build scripts included with Dojo, helps in constructing a custom profile which includes only those modules used by your application. This tool automatically processess the require statements from the Dojo source without any intervention from the user.<br>
</p>

<br>

<b>Janitor<a name="Janitor"></a></b> 
  <p> Use janitor task to strip out unused functions from the JavaScript source code. Janitor performs a static code analysis constructing a function call 
    graph for all global functions. Global statements are considered entry points into the call graph. Every function not reachable from the graph is considered unused and gets removed. 
  </p>

  <p> There are two cases where the analysis needs help from the user: Functions that are only called by the server (through the pipe), and functions that 
    are composed with string concatenation of the function name which then gets passed to eval or similar reflective functionality. The user can enumerate 
    the function names in these cases in a property that declares them protected from removal.</p>
  <p> The entry points are calculated from all global statements in all JavaScript source code visible to the tool in that run. This might not be desirable, 
    so there is a property that when set to true makes the task only consider JavaScript code that was actually imported in an import statement in an HTML 
    file.</p>

  <p> Here are all the properties for the janitor task that can be specified in 
    a property file:</p>

                <p><b> Janitor Properties:</b></p>
                <p><b> task.janitor.entries</b><br>
                      The global entry points into the code (things that are used, 
                      but not called explicitly in code). These are the identifiers 
                      that should be protected from removal but won't get revealed 
                      as such by the call graph analysis. Entries should be simple 
                      identifiers, not composite names. For example to protect 
                      <code>MUMusic.render</code> the entry <code>render</code> 
                      should be added to the list. Simple wildcards are supported: 
                      * and ?. They have the same meaning as in file system wildcards.<br>
                  (optional property) </p>

                The flag that controls whether only JavaScript source files which 
                are actually imported by HTML files are considered when running

                <p><b><i> Note:</i></b><i> When setting the second property to 
                  true, the tool will need the webroot property set to a valid 
                  directory.</i></p>

   <br>
  <b>Muffler<a name="Muffler"></a></b> 
  <p>Muffler task removes developer noise like alert and assert statements. 
    For now, only explicit function calls are being removed. For specified identifiers 
    that match declared global functions, the function declarations themselves 
    are removed. Examples of statements that are removed are:</p>
  <pre id="noteTable"> 
	assert(foo < 3);

	alert("this is a fire drill");
  </pre>
  <br/>
  The identifiers can be composite names like <b>dig.debug.log</b> and can have 
  wildcards in them. The wildcard syntax is the familiar syntax from file system 
  wildcards, with <b>*</b> and <b>?</b> augmented with an additional wildcard 
  pattern <b>**</b> for any number of segments in a composite identifier. 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b> Example:</b></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><b> dig.log.** matches dig.log.foo, dig.log.info, dig.log.info.warning 
        etc.</b></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Muffler also removes code that cannot be reached if certain specified identifiers 
    have declared Boolean values. For example, by declaring the identifier <b>debug 
    = false</b>, the code inside the following if-statement cannot be reached, 
    and so is stripped:</p>
  <pre id="noteTable"> 
	if ( debug ) {

		alert ( "here" );

	}
  </pre>

<b>Print<a name="Print"></a></b> 
  <p>Print task writes out the result, stripping whitespace, newlines and/or 
    comments if desired. If this task is omitted from the task list, then the 
    run is like a dry-run that won't write out anything. The user can look in 
    the log files to check that the run is doing what is expected, and then add 
    this task to the task list to do the actual writing out of the results. The 
    exception is the ogredoc task that generates output without the help of this 
    task.</p>
  <p> The print result is written out in an output directory and the files are 
    written in a directory tree structure that is identical to the input directory 
    structure. Since the input can be a list of input directories, the output 
    tree structure will start at the point where the input directories differ 
    (the common prefix is not mirrored). The output can also be done in place 
    by specifying a property.</p>
  <p> By specifying pretty-printing properties, one can control the stripping 
    of newlines, whitespace and comments.</p>
