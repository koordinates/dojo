Status
------------------------

Dojo is under heavy development. We have finished a significant portion of the
core "plumbing" for the project. Widgets are under development by multiple open
source and commercial efforts, and many of these are being contributed back to
the community. Dojo has been successfully deployed in mutliple commercial
products including Jot, TurboAjax, Renkoo, Loomia, GreenPlum, and several others.

More details are available in the `Dojo Roadmap`_
