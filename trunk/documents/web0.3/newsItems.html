	<p>The day will revolve around hacking and discussions around the various topics that everyone is hacking on. The day will start with getting to know everyone and at 10:30 we'll open up the whiteboard to listing ad-hoc discussion groups that will meet to hack and discuss throught the day. Participation in any of the groups is entirely optional, but they provide a place for people thinking about the same problem to work on it and not miss other discussions that interest them. At about 5:30 we'll break for lightning demos. If you've got something cool to show, this is your chance but it'll have to be very short. 10 minutes tops (5 preferred). After that, we break for food and beer!</p>
