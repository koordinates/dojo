	<p>The day will revolve around hacking and discussions around the various topics that everyone is hacking on. The day will start with getting to know everyone and at 10:30 we'll open up the whiteboard to listing ad-hoc discussion groups that will meet to hack and discuss throught the day. Participation in any of the groups is entirely optional, but they provide a place for people thinking about the same problem to work on it and not miss other discussions that interest them. At about 5:30 we'll break for lightning demos. If you've got something cool to show, this is your chance but it'll have to be very short. 10 minutes tops (5 preferred). After that, we break for food and beer!</p>

	<h2>What is Dojo?</h2>

	<p>
		Dojo is the Open Source JavaScript toolkit that helps you build
		serious applications in less time. It fills in the gaps where
		JavaScript and browsers don't go quite far enough, and gives you
		powerful, portable, lightweight, and tested tools for constructing
		dynamic interfaces. Dojo lets you prototype interactive widgets
		quickly, animate transitions, and build Ajax requests with the most
		powerful and easiest to use abstractions available. These
		capabilities are built on top of a lightweight packaging system, so
		you never have to figure out which order to request script files in
		again. Dojo's package system and optional build tools help you
		develop quickly and optimize transparently.
	</p>
	<p>
		Dojo also packs an easy to use widget system. From prototype to
		deployment, Dojo widgets are HTML and CSS all the way. Best of all,
		since Dojo is portable JavaScript to the core, your widgets can be
		portable between HTML, SVG, and whatever else comes down the pike.
		The web is changing, and Dojo can help you stay ahead.
	</p>
	<p>
		Dojo makes professional web development better, easier, and faster.
		In that order.
