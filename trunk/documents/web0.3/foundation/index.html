		<h2><a name="license"></a>Licensing</h2>
		<p>
			Dojo is Open Source software, distributed by a non-profit foundation which
			has been set up for the purpose of providing a vendor-neutral owner of Dojo
			intellectual property. In order to ensure to users of Foundation projects
			that there is no ambiguity or hidden liability regarding the use of
			Foundation code, all contributors are required to provide signed
			Contributor License Agreements (<a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/icla.txt">individual</a> 
			and <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/ccla.txt">corporate</a>). 
		</p>
		<p>
			The Dojo Toolkit is currently dual-licensed. The preferred license is the
			<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/afl-2.1.php">Academic Free License
			v2.1</a>. All Dojo Foundation projects release their code under the terms
			of this license. It is almost never necessary to exercise the "dual"
			portion of the dual-licensing terms since the AFL is well written, widely
			accepted, and incredibly permissive.
		</p>
		<p>
			For users who face the problem of artificial ambiguity the FSF has created
			regarding the compatibility of the AFL and the (L)GPL, The Dojo Toolkit
			may alternately be used under the terms of the <a
			href="http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">BSD License</a>. Both
			the AFL and the BSD licenses meet the licensing goals of the Dojo
			Foundation.
		</p>
		<p>
			This "dual licensing" system is similar to licensing systems employed by
			projects such as MySQL and the Mozilla Foundation. In almost every case,
			you will not need to understand the differences between the Dojo licenses
			or choose anything other than the AFL. If you have questions regarding Dojo
			licensing, please do not hesitate to contact <a
			href="mailto:alex@dojotoolkit.org">Alex Russell</a>, current President of
			the Dojo Foundation.
