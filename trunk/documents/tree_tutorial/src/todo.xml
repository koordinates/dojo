            <listitem>Automated unit-testing system based on Selenium </listitem>
            <listitem>Optimize all gifs with AGO (advanced gif optimizer) carefully. AGO spoils transparent gifs. It may make single layer LESS than 
                reported image size, that'd lead to background-repeat effect under OS X or Opera.
            </listitem>        
            <listitem>Make SortChildren extension to keep nodes sorted</listitem>
            <listitem>Make DisableSelection extension to keep node selection</listitem>
            <listitem>On Drag'n'drop tree 'wobbles', because node size increases/decreases when it is
                bordered.  Could be nice to evade it, either placing another transparent div with border onto
                the node or decreasing their size, or using padding divs, or..</listitem>
      <listitem>Add checkbox extension. Every node will have checkbox, can save/restore checked state. When parent is checked,
      all children are marked "grey-checked", user may uncheck grey-checked nodes. grey-checked dependant nodes removed if parent is unchecked.</listitem>

        <title>Problems to solve</title>
        
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>Multiple dnd of nodes selected by multiple select work incorrectly. Although all is fine if dragManager
                uses shift for multiple dnd and TreeSelector uses ctrl. No idea what the reason is.</listitem>
            <listitem><simpara>Drag'n'drop onDrop errors can't be handled. Need a way to hook on e.g permission denied errors.</simpara>
            </listitem>
            <listitem><simpara>When I expand a large tree and try to move its top (dnd), node starts to move after a pause - a gap in time between
                I start moving node with my mouse and dragClone appears. Lots of calculations?</simpara></listitem>
            <listitem><simpara>wipe and fade togglers are broken</simpara></listitem>
            <listitem><simpara>can't add subwidgets in title. Seems I need to put them to children, and children property will contain
            not only subnodes, but also title widgets.. Will need to fix a lot.</simpara></listitem>
