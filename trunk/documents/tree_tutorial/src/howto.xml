        <title>Make tree unselectable</title>
        <para>Sometimes people want tree nodes to be unselectable, sometimes selection is a good way to copy (part of) content from the node.</para>
        <para>To make tree (or its elements) unselectable use dojo.html.disableSelection in nodeCreate and treeCreate hooks.
            Apply disableSelection to every node you want to make unselectable.

        <para>TODO: selectable tree extension (chunk): tree.addExtension("unselectable");</para>
