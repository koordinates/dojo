        This documentation refers to new TreeV3, not to stable Tree widget.
        Feel free to suggest features and test/critisize existing solutions.

        Basic things are shown in tests (dojo/tests/widget/treeV3), so you might want to check them first and copy-paste
        exactly the things you need. The tutorial is meant to provide deeper understanding for those
        who want to extend/modify tree behavior.
