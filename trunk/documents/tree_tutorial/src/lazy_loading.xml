        <title>How to load *not* TreeNodes ?</title>
        
        <para>You can pass objects as element of <methodname>children</methodname> array, but you can also pass arrays.
            If you pass objects, they are treated as data objects for TreeNodes, but arrays are treated as arguments for createWidget call.
        E.g if you want to <code>createWidget("MyWidgetNodeType", {title:'somedata'})</code>, then you pass
            ["MyWidgetNodeType, {title:'somedata'}] instead of just {title:'somedata'} from server (or in setChildren call).
        </para>
        
        <para>Another option is to change <methodname>defaultChildWidgetType</methodname> property of the tree.
            Helpful in case when you have your own widgets and use them elsewhere instead of TreeNode</para>
