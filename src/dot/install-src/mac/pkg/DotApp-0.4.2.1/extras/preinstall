# of these GUIDs corresponds to a different possible networking
# endpoint. We aren't interested in all of these; one is for
# Bluetooth, for example. For each GUID, we see if it has
# a sub-dict named "Interface" with the name of this interface,
# defined in "UserDefinedName" -- which despite it's name, is not
# set by the user, but the name given by Mac OS X -- they are not
# changeable through a UI. We only want
# two of these GUID children: one with the UserDefinedName
# of "Built-in Ethernet" for ethernet, and "AirPort" for WiFi.
